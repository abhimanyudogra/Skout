Function: File system search engine with arithematic and logical processing capabilities. Designed for fishing relevant log file entries.

Currently supported OS is LINUX (Future: Might add Windows compatibility.)

USAGE: 
The script has two interfaces, shell-based and GUI (made in PyQt)

GUI USAGE: Run "genloggui.py" for deploying the scipt in GUI mode.

Shell USAGE: Run "genlog.py" for deplying the script in LINUX shell.
	    use  "$python genlog.py --help" for information on usage. 
	    
Guide to the fields used in the script:
Search Field: On using this field, the lines of interest are found by searching for the specified string. Available  special keywords are 
<<alphas>>: For matching any word. 
<<alphanums>>: For matching all word + number	combinations. 
<<int>>: For matching all pure numbers. 
<<decimal>>: For matching decimal numbers.

Regex Field: The lines of interest are found by matching the specified regular expression.

File Path: Specify the log file name/relative path. Default: current directory

Condition Field:Currently supported arithematic operators are: "+" "-" "*" "/" "<" ">=" "<=" "=" which can be combined with "!" (left assosiative),"&"(and) and "|"(or) logical operators.
Time format for the log file as well as the rule string is specified in and can be modified from "patterns.cfg" configuration file.
Time can be accessed using the "time" keyword and all operators work on time objects except for arithematic "*" "/" "+" "-".
Example : (time<=11:49:00.000000).
Use parenthesis only to override the pre-configured standard operator precedence as it slows down the parsing grammar.
